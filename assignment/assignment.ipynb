        "**Q4.** Many important datasets contain a race variable, typically limited to a handful of values often including Black, White, Asian, Latino, and Indigenous. This question looks at data gathering efforts on this variable by the U.S. Federal government.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How did the most recent US Census gather data on race?\n",
        "The most recent U.S. Census collected race data by asking people to identify their racial background. Individuals could select one or more races, including White, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, or Some Other Race. Additionally, the Census asked a separate question about Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin, recognizing it as an ethnicity rather than a race.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why do we gather these data? What role do these kinds of data play in politics and society? Why does data quality matter?\n",
        "We gather this data to ensure fair representation in government and enforce laws. These data help communities receive certain funding or gain insight into demographic trends. Data quality matters because inaccurate data can lead to unfair distribution of resources and social inequality throughout the country.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
        "The Census did well in collecting data in a concise matter that grouped individuals into easy to understand categories. However, the Census could have done better by including more categories for individuals of specific races other than just grouping them into groups such as \"Other Pacific Islander\" or \"Some Other Race\". Including more groups could offer insight into the diversity of the population and help communities receive more accurate representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How did the Census gather data on sex and gender? Please provide a similar constructive criticism of their practices.\n",
        "The Census gathered data on sex and gender by asking individuals to identify as male or female and not providing options for other gender identities such as non-binary. The Census does not account for gender diversity and may result in individuals being underrepresented in the data. The census could improve by including questions such as assigned gender at birth and current gender identification to provide more inclusive and accurate data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When it comes to cleaning data, what concerns do you have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race? What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why?\n",
        "With people having a diverse amount of races or gender identities, this could lead to problems with cleaning data as some individuals may not fit into the categories provided. Having people fill in their identity could lead to a lot of values that would be difficult to clean. Some may group individuals wrongly when cleaning data which could lead to inaccuracies.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have?\n",
        "An algorithm like this could lead to bias if it relies on discriminatory data which would misclassify individuals. Imputing values such as these could lead to privacy concerns as individuals should have control over how their identities are recorded. Such inaccuracies could lead to flawed funding or policy decisions. Such algorithms could lead to misuse and harm several underrepresented groups."
